# 🚀 Student Performance Prediction (End-to-End ML Project)
This project is part of my AI/ML learning journey (from Krish Naik’s course on Udemy).
It is my first end-to-end Machine Learning project, where I built, trained, and deployed a model to predict student exam performance based on various input features.

## 📌 Project Overview
- Built a regression model to predict student scores.
- Used multiple machine learning models:
    - Linear Regression
    - Decision Tree Regressor
    - Random Forest Regressor
    - Gradient Boosting Regressor
    - AdaBoost Regressor
    - K-Neighbors Regressor
    - XGB Regressor
    - CatBoost Regressor
- Evaluated performance using metrics like R² Score.
- Selected the best performing model for deployment.

## 🎯 Key Learnings

- How to build an end-to-end ML pipeline:

    - Data collection & cleaning

    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    - Feature engineering

    - Model training & evaluation

    - Saving model using Pickle/Joblib

    - Deploying with Flask and HTML UI

- Learned about MLOps concepts like modular coding, logging, and CI/CD.

- Improved my understanding of model selection and hyperparameter tuning.
